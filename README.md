# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022.
I'm solving it in Rust to learn the language.

## Build instructions

1. Change the path of `[[bin]]` in [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) to the day you want to compile
2. Change the `main` for that day to solve the part you want
3. Run `cargo run` to run on input.txt for that day (my personal inputs) or `cargo test` to run the tests.
